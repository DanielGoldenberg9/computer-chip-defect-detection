# computer-chip defect detection

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on defect detection in computer chips using classical computer vision techniques. The project utilizes various image processing methods to identify defects with high accuracy and reliability.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes classical computer vision techniques to achieve high accuracy in defect detection.
- **Robust Image Processing**: Implements a variety of image processing methods such as filtering, morphological operations, SIFT detection, Phase-correlation, and Kmeans.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing defects on chips.
- **segmentation map**: returns an image of the defect with sub-pixel accuracy.

## Technologies
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and classical computer vision methods.
- **Scikit-learn**: For statistical analysis and metrics calculation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For data manipulation and processing.
